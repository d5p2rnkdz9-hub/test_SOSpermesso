## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: RTL/i18n foundation must be Phase 1 (35x retrofitting cost avoidance)
- [Roadmap]: Validate tree engine in Italian only before adding multilingual (reduce debugging complexity)
- [Roadmap]: Arabic RTL polish folded into Phase 4 (needs real translated content to test BiDi)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flags Phase 2 (Decision Tree Engine) may need research if graph traversal reveals complex loops
- Research flags Phase 4 may need research for Crowdin API integration specifics
- AI translation hallucination risk for legal terms (17-88% rate) -- mitigated by locked glossary approach in Phase 4
